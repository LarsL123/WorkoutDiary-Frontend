# WorkoutDiary-Frontend

The front-end for my workout diary application.

----Notes for development:

    Grid system:

The main gird feature may use the grid system from bootstrap --> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/
I have not really looked into it but it may be restricted to 12 columns.
That may be good but think we would need more.
Also i dont know about the scaling if everythink is just scaled deown or if som of the columns dissapear.

Or this --> https://www.grapecity.com/blogs/build-a-react-data-grid-in-minutes ---> https://www.grapecity.com/blogs/wijmo-flexgrid-best-react-data-grid
Are very simmelar to an excel grid. I hope i can make the grid pettier than this. Have to se if it can be stylized colored ect.
